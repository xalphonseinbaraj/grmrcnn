This python package is used for object detection that combines Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping++ (Grad-CAM++) for localization and Mask Regional Convolution Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) for object detection. Hence this model is knowns as GradCAM-MLRCNN

This architecture of the model

We are applied this model for various pretrained models like VGG16,VGG19,ResNet 101, ResNet 152 and ResNet 50.
This python package is exclusively for ResNet 50 only. 
For remaining pretrained models, still under development process
